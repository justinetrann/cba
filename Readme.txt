The commands below were used to create the database Store_Data to store the sample data found in One Drive. MySQL Workbench allows its users to import
data through File Path. Manutally converting the xlsx file to csv I imported the file into the empty Table Store_Data. The next step is to convert the strings into
its acceptable forms for example total_sales should be converted to DECIMAL(10,2) in order apply future mathmatically operations.
